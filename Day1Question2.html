<h2> Question 2 </h2>
<p> Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.</p>

<p> let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.</p>

<p>Variables declared by let have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function</p>

<p>Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned:</p>
